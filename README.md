# SortingProject

PART 1 

Use provided algorithm files (merge, quick, heap, shell) and modify to handle generic objects and test in main program using an Integer object array. Develop a test program that includes a common generic print array method and a common generic method to verify that an array of objects is properly ordered. 

Files: 
1) Final java class files for each of the generic sorts (merge, quick, heap and shell). Comments identify where and how the code was changed from the original provided code.
2) Main code to test and verify all of the sorts using an Integer object array. The output displays an unordered array prior to each sort and then a final sorted array after each sort and lastly a verification statement that the resulting array is properly sorted (from a common generic method to verify the order of the array).
 
The provided code implements the merge, quick, shell and heap sorts for int arrays (primitives, not Integer objects). The code includes a print method and main code to test the sort for int arrays.

Main code which tests the modified generic sort with an Integer object array. 
Use the group code to run each of the sorting algorithms on one of their own original subclasses from my inheritance assignment. Write main code to demonstrate each of the sorting algorithms for their subclass. This requires implementing the comparable interface for the custom class and creating an array of their custom objects for sorting. Each sort must be demonstrated with an unsorted array, properly displayed, and verified using the verification method in the group code.
