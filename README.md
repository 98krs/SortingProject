# SortingProject

PART 1 

Learning Objectives: Understand sorting algorithms and their code implementation. Practice analyzing, modifying and integrating code. Practice with use of generics for developing modular and reusable code. 

Use provided algorithm files (merge, quick, heap, shell) and modify to handle generic objects and test in main program using an Integer object array. Develop a test program that includes a common generic print array method and a common generic method to verify that an array of objects is properly ordered. 

Files: 
1) Final java class files for each of the generic sorts (merge, quick, heap and shell). Comments identify where and how the code was changed from the original provided code.
2)Main code to test and verify all of the sorts using an Integer object array. The output will display a properly formatted and labeled unordered array prior to each sort and then a final sorted array after each sort (each sort must start with an unordered array) and lastly a verification statement that the resulting array is properly sorted (from a common generic method to verify the order of the array).
 
Use the group code with their custom classes from the inheritance assignment. 
The provided code implements the merge, quick, shell and heap sorts for int arrays (primitives, not Integer objects). The code includes a print method and main code to test the sort for int arrays.

PART 2
Learning Objectives: Understand sorting algorithms and their code implementation. Practice modifying custom class code for use with library classes, specifically implementation of the Comparable interface. 
This is the individual portion of the programming assignment on sorting. First, students will submit their individual main code by which they tested their sort with an Integer object array. For the rest of this submission, students will use the group code provided for part 1 to run each of the sorting algorithms on one of their own original subclasses from their inheritance assignment. The student will write their own main code to demonstrate each of the sorting algorithms for their subclass. Note this will require implementing the comparable interface for their custom class and creating an array of their custom objects for sorting. Each sort must be demonstrated with an unsorted array, properly displayed, and verified using the verification method in the group code. Students may choose their own approach for ordering their custom objects, but be sure to clearly state how your custom objects are compared in the comments of your provided class code. 
Your submission must include the following:
1) Your main code used to test your individual generic sort with an Integer object array.
2) Your modified class and subclass code showing implementation of the Comparable interface.
3) Your main code used to demonstrate each of the sorting methods with your custom subclass.
4) Execution screenshots showing arrays before and after each sort and the results of the verification method.
